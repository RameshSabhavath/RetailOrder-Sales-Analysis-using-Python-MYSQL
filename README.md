# Retails-Sales-Analysis-using-Python-MYSQL

End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my comprehensive data analytics project! This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for analyzing retail order data using both Python and SQL. It highlights my ability to manage real-world datasets from ingestion to insights, showcasing strong technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills that align well with data analyst roles.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

This project illustrates the full journey of working with large datasets — from acquisition and preparation to analysis and interpretation.

<h3>High-Level Breakdown:</h3>

1. Data Extraction: Datasets were accessed programmatically through the Kaggle API, ensuring reproducibility and efficiency.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Leveraged Python with Pandas to handle incomplete records, standardize formats, normalize data, and remove inconsistencies.

3. Database Integration: Transformed and loaded the refined dataset into SQL Server to enable structured querying and scalable analytics.

4. Data Analysis: Applied advanced SQL queries to explore the data, conduct aggregations, and derive insights that drive decision-making.

<h3>Project Architecture</h3>

Workflow Components:

Kaggle API: Automated dataset download for streamlined access.

Python & Pandas: Executed cleaning operations, including:

Addressing missing or inconsistent values

Transforming column formats for uniformity

Detecting and eliminating duplicate entries

SQL Server: Stored and queried the cleaned dataset to conduct detailed analysis.

SQL-Based Analysis: Designed queries to:

Aggregate and summarize sales data

Detect customer and product-level trends

Generate actionable insights for strategy and planning

<h3>Skills Highlighted</h3>

Python Expertise: Practical application of Pandas and related libraries for data transformation and wrangling.

SQL Proficiency: Advanced use of SQL for querying, grouping, and analyzing datasets.

ETL Workflow Design: Built an efficient end-to-end Extract–Transform–Load pipeline.

Analytical Thinking: Tackled data quality issues and ensured analysis accuracy to support reliable outcomes.

<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/RameshSabhavath/Retails-Sales-Analysis-using-Python-MYSQL.git


Install Required Libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Download the Dataset: Use the Kaggle API (instructions provided in the notebook).

Preprocess the Data:

Order Data Analysis.ipynb (interactive notebook with detailed steps)

orders data analysis.py (script version for automation)

Load Data into SQL Server: Follow the included setup guide.

Execute SQL Queries: Run SQLQuery3.sql to replicate the analysis.

<h3>Repository Contents</h3>

Order Data Analysis.ipynb – Notebook documenting preprocessing and cleaning.

orders data analysis.py – Python script to automate preprocessing tasks.

SQLQuery3.sql – SQL queries designed for exploration and analysis.

orders.csv – Raw dataset containing retail orders.

project architecture.png – Diagram of the project workflow.

README.md – Project documentation and overview.

<h3>Key Insights Generated</h3>

Identified highest-revenue products and their share of total sales.

Analyzed customer buying behavior to guide marketing initiatives.

Determined seasonal and peak demand periods for inventory optimization.

Segmented customers by order frequency and value, enabling targeted promotions.

<h3>Why This Project Stands Out</h3>

This project provides a holistic view of the data analytics lifecycle, covering every step from raw input to strategic recommendations. It demonstrates technical fluency, an eye for data quality, and the ability to transform information into meaningful business insights — critical capabilities for a data analyst career path.
